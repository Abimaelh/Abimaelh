### Hi there! 🙋🏽‍♂️

I'm [**Abimael**](https://abimaelh.github.io/), a master's student in computational linguistics at the University of Washington.

I'm currently developing a tool to help developmental psychologists streamline the annotation of child speech data. Previously, I managed a research lab at the University of Pennsylvania, leading eye-tracking studies on how children comprehend verb predicates.

My interests lie in building language technologies that enhance accessibility — such as speech-based search tools, improved machine translation, and more natural text-to-speech systems.

Outside of work, I love reading, working out, and learning new languages.
