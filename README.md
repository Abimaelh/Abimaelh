## Hi there! 🙋🏽‍♂️

I'm Abimael, a master's student in computational linguistics at the University of Washington.

I am currently working on a tool that would help developmental psychologists cut down the time it takes to annotate child speech data. Previously, I was a lab manager at the University of Pennslyvania where I led eye-tracking studies on children's understanding of verb predicates.
