### Hi there! 🙋🏽‍♂️

I'm **Abimael**, a recent M.S. graduate in Computational Linguistics (UW, Aug 2025) with hands-on experience in **AI and machine learning**.

At **xAI** and **Meta**, I:

* Automated multimodal annotation workflows with Python/Regex, saving 43+ hours across 128 audio files.
* Designed evaluation frameworks and scored 645+ tasks to improve ASR, image generation, and video understanding models.

Previously, I led **child language research** at the University of Pennsylvania and co-authored a [BioLaySumm ACL 2025 Paper](https://github.com/Abimaelh/Abimaelh/blob/main/papers/2025-bionlp-share.pdf), where our summarization system ranked 2nd in readability.

I’m eager to apply my **data science and ML** skills to build accessible, high-impact language technologies. Outside of tech, I love the gym, reading, and journaling!
